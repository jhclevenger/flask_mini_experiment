        <h1>Hello! Welcome to our super scientific science experiment.</h1>
        <div><p>During the experiment, you'll be shown a number of clothing items. <br>
            You'll see two items at a time, and your job is to tell us which one you'd rather buy. Pretty simple, right? <br>
            Please make sure that you're confident in your selection, but try to answer quickly.</p></div>
